The `BadEcho.MsdfGenerator` library is a [Bad Echo](https://badecho.com) C++/CLI wrapper for the unmanaged [msdf-atlas-gen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdf-atlas-gen) library.

Using this library will allow you to generate compact MSDF font atlases from managed code. This project utilizes vcpkg to retrieve and build msdf-atlas-gen and all of its dependencies.

This package exists to be used by Bad Echo software, but is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License so that others may enjoy it as well; see the accompanying [license](https://github.com/BadEcho/core/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for details.

## About Bad Echo
Bad Echo is a collection of software technologies and [various writings](https://badecho.com) by Matt Weber: a software designer, partnered [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/omni) streamer, and game developer.

While Bad Echo code concerns itself a great deal with the "best approaches" to general software problems, it also focuses on game development and providing entertainment through the clever manipulation of games (the results of which are streamed by myself).

## Getting in Contact
I'm a partnered Twitch streamer, and talking to me during one of my [Omnified streams](https://twitch.tv/omni), on the off chance that I actually _am_ streaming, is most definitely the quickest way to get my attention!
